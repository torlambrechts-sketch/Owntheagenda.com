# Assessments module — implementation & gaps

## What ships now (this change)

A new **Assessments library** (`AssessmentLibrary.tsx`, rendered by `/assessments`)
matching the design: **library → detail → run → report**.

- **Library** — instrument cards grouped *Personality* (individual) and *Team*,
  driven by the real `assessment_template` catalog (+ the Leadership Effectiveness
  test as an external card). Each card shows dimensions, ~time, and a "Completed"
  badge when the signed-in user has taken it.
- **Detail** — About (description) + "What it measures" (dimension chips) +
  Details facts (type, dimensions, questions, time, basis, scale, your status),
  with **View sample report** and **Run assessment** actions.
- **Run** — a real Likert run over the instrument's items (from
  `assessment_template.definition`), progress + per-question card, persisted via
  `submit_individual_response(workspace, key, scores)` (verified end-to-end).
- **Report** — a per-dimension band table (fill + score), expandable rows with the
  dimension definition and a band read, a **Full / Personal** toggle (Personal hides
  raw scores → dots), and a footer (basis, scale). **View sample report** renders an
  illustrative profile so users can see the format before taking it.

The existing **team pulse / multi-item survey** tools (aggregate, perception gap,
trends) are preserved below the library under "Team dynamics".

## Gaps (development perspective)

Ordered by impact. Each is additive — nothing here blocks the flow above.

1. **✅ DONE — Authored per-trait report content.** Added `assessment_trait_copy`
   (`template_key, dimension_key, definition, advantages[], risks[], statements[]`,
   global reference content, RLS `select using (true)`), seeded for the catalog
   instruments, and wired into the report: each expandable dimension row now shows
   the authored *definition*, *Where it helps*, *Watch-outs* (Full view only), and
   *People with this result often recognise…* statements, falling back to the
   dimension blurb when a row is absent.

2. **✅ DONE — Team-aggregate report wired into the library.** A team instrument's run
   now contributes to the team's open survey (`submit_survey_response`) when one is
   open, else stores a personal response. `/assessments` enriches each team catalog
   item with `openSurveyId` (latest open survey of that kind) and `teamReport`
   (the anonymised aggregate from `survey_results` on the latest survey — min-3
   masked). The detail view shows a **View team report →** action (hidden while
   masked) that renders the same band table from the aggregated dimension means,
   and a contextual note (responses so far / report unlocks at 3 / open to
   contribute). Verified `survey_results` shape end-to-end against live data.

3. **Assignment / invitations.** No model for "assign this instrument to these people"
   — team members are implicitly eligible through an open survey. The detail's
   "Assign people" (in the design) needs an assignment record + reminder hooks.

4. **Reference norms / percentiles for individual instruments.** Bands are raw
   position on the scale, not population-relative. Team surveys have a benchmark pool
   (`benchmark_sample`); individual instruments (working style, strengths) have none,
   so "in the top X%" isn't possible yet.

5. **✅ DONE — Item depth + reverse scoring for catalog instruments.**
   `working_style` and `strengths_snapshot` now carry **4 items per dimension** (16
   total, up from 8), each dimension gaining one **reverse-keyed** item
   (`"reverse": true` in the JSONB definition) to blunt acquiescence bias. Scoring
   flips reverse items onto the dimension pole before averaging — in both the
   client run (`AssessmentLibrary.scoreFrom`) and the shared item→dimension reducer
   (`lib/survey.dimensionMeans`, which also feeds the team aggregate). Verified the
   arithmetic (genuinely-high → max, yes-to-all acquiescence → mid, genuinely-low →
   min). These instruments score entirely client-side, so the server composite /
   benchmark path is untouched; reverse keys remain off team instruments until
   `private.survey_composite` is made reverse-aware. `working_style.focus` was
   re-grounded on concentration/depth (matching its authored copy and "Focus"
   label) with fresh item keys so prior responses drop cleanly.

6. **Candidate sharing & export are stubs.** "Share with candidate" and PDF/export are
   not implemented (export shows a toast). Needs a shareable individual-report surface
   (respecting `individual_response.shared`) and a print/PDF route.

7. **Longitudinal history for individuals.** `individual_response` keeps one row per
   (user, template) — retaking overwrites. No personal trend over time (team pulses do
   have `team_dynamics_history`).

8. **Unify the Leadership test.** The 63-item leadership inventory is a separate
   run/score/report flow (`/assessments/leadership`); it's linked as an external card
   rather than run/reported inside the library.

9. **Authoring UI.** Custom instruments can only be created by inserting
   `assessment_template` rows directly — no admin UI to define dimensions/items.
